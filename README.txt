# ðŸš¨ Emergency Sound Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects **emergency sounds** such as explosions, fire alarms, gunshots, and human screams using a **CNN-based sound classification model**.  
It employs **Mel-spectrogram feature extraction** and **deep learning** to classify critical sound events that could indicate emergency situations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
To develop a reliable sound classification system capable of distinguishing between emergency and non-emergency sounds to enhance safety and automated alert systems.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset consists of the following categories:
- **Explosion dataset/**
- **Fire/**
- **GunShots/**
- **Scream/**
- **Non_scream/**

Each folder contains `.wav` audio samples used for training and testing.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
The model is a hybrid **CNN and BiGRU hybrid neural network** designed to process Mel-spectrograms extracted from audio signals.  
Key layers include:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction  
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
- Dense layers for classification

## ðŸ§® Feature Extraction
Mel-spectrograms are generated using **Librosa**, converting raw audio into a visual timeâ€“frequency representation suitable for CNN processing.
